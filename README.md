# Sentiment Analysis for Crisis Management
Project Overview
Our project focuses on developing and deploying a sentiment analysis system tailored for crisis management. 
The primary objective is to provide humanitarian organizations and governments in developing countries with a 
powerful tool to understand real-time insights and trends during crises. 
We have implemented a user-friendly dashboard using the Streamlit application framework, 
enabling easy visualization and interpretation of sentiment analysis results.


Features
Sentiment Analysis: The system employs natural language processing techniques to analyze sentiments from textual data related to various crises.
Real-time Insights: The dashboard provides real-time updates on the sentiment trends, allowing organizations to stay informed about public 
opinions during critical situations.
Geospatial Analysis: The system categorizes sentiments based on geographical locations, enabling a targeted response in different regions.
